Somali people are well known on poems, so the data is a various poems collected from this link (http://www.farshaxan.com/Gabayaa/hadraawi.html). Somali is an Afroasiatic language belonging to the Cushitic branch. It is an official language of Somalia and Somaliland, a national language in Djibouti, and a working language in the Somali Region of Ethiopia and also in North Eastern Kenya. it is written in Latin and spoken approximately by 36.6 million speakers spread in Greater Somalia (i.e. concept that unite all Somali speaking nations).
